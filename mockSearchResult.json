He changed the game and without him, music - and more specifically hip hop - would not be in the medium it is today. From growing up in the Marcy Projects of Brooklyn, his life has two main stories: The story of the rapper and the story of the hustler. These two tales overlap just as much as they diverge. Jay-Z has made rap accessible to a wide audience but never lost sight of who he is."

But as a rapper, he’s sometimes not given the credit he deserves for just how great an artist he’s been for so long.<br /><br />This audiobook wrestles with the biggest themes of JAY-Z's career, including hustling, and it recognizes the way that he’s always weaved politics into his music, making important statements about race, criminal justice, black wealth and social injustice. As he enters his fifties, and to mark his thirty years as a recording artist, this is the perfect time to take a look at JAY-Z’s career and his role in making this nation what it is today. In many ways, this is JAY-Z’s America as much as it’s Pelosi’s America, or Trump’s America, or Martin Luther King’s America. JAY-Z has given this country a language to think with and words to live by."

A modern-day King Midas, everything he touches—sports bars, streaming services, record labels, and cognac—turns to gold. How exactly did he do it?<br /><br /><i>Forbes</i> senior editor Zack O'Malley Greenburg reveals the story of Jay Z's legendary rise from the Marcy Projects of Brooklyn to stages and corner offices worldwide. He draws on over 100 interviews with those who knew Jay Z from the beginning: his classmates at George Westinghouse High School; the childhood friend who got him into the drug trade; and the DJ who convinced him to stop dealing and focus on the music. Also bearing witness are the artists who worked alongside him, including J. Cole and Alicia Keys.<br /><br />Jay Z's life is a blueprint for any hustler, businessperson, and entrepreneur who seeks to build something spectacular."

      "description": "Throughout American history, Black people were not given the freedom to acknowledge their suffering. A. D. Thomason believes that the Holy Spirit brings freedom and liberation as we're able to name our pain, recognize its roots in history and society, and seek healing.<br /><br />While many saw a confident, six-foot-five Black man, A. D. \"Lumkile\" Thomason lived most of his life in fear and anguish, deeply wounded by encounters with violence, abandonment, and family tragedy. Hiding behind a tough exterior, Adam earned his \"Black card\" but felt joyless inside. Even traveling around the globe to play professional basketball could not resolve his despair.<br /><br />But in the art of Jay-Z, A. D. discovered stirring honesty that gave voice to his own expressions of longing. And in the gospel of Jesus, he experienced the healing and salvation that had long evaded him. A. D. uses his artistry as a poet and storyteller to share how he confessed his internalized pain and embraced the liberating joy of Christ. He writes for millennials, emerging adults, and anyone else who's ready to acknowledge the reality of racial trauma and our need to confront it. His powerful story gives you permission to be Black, to be Christian, and to be the person God has made you to be."

      "description": "\"I'm not a businessman-I'm a business, man.\" <br />--Jay-Z <br /><br />Some people think Jay-Z is just another rapper. Others see him as just another celebrity/mega-star. The reality is, no matter what you think Jay-Z is, he first and foremost a business. And as much as Martha Stewart or Oprah, he has turned himself into a lifestyle. <br /><br />You can wake up to the local radio station playing Jay-Z's latest hit, spritz yourself with his 9IX cologne, slip on a pair of his Rocawear jeans, lace up your Reebok S. Carter sneakers, catch a Nets basketball game in the afternoon, and grab dinner at The Spotted Pig before heading to an evening performance of the Jay-Z-backed Broadway musical Fela! and a nightcap at his 40/40 Club. He'll profit at every turn of your day. <br /><br />But despite Jay-Z's success, there are still many Americans whose impressions of him are foggy, outdated, or downright incorrect. Surprisingly to many, he honed his business philosophy not at a fancy B school, but on the streets of Brooklyn, New York and beyond as a drug dealer in the 1980s. <br /><br />Empire State of Mind tells the story behind Jay-Z's rise to the top as told by the people who lived it with him- from classmates at Brooklyn's George Westinghouse High School; to the childhood friend who got him into the drug trade; to the DJ who convinced him to stop dealing and focus on music. This audio book explains just how Jay-Z propelled himself from the bleak streets of Brooklyn to the heights of the business world. <br /><br />Zack O'Malley Greenburg draws on his one-on-one interviews with hip-hop luminaries such as DJ Clark Kent, Questlove of The Roots, Damon Dash, Fred \"Fab 5 Freddy\" Brathwaite, MC Serch; NBA stars Jamal Crawford and Sebastian Telfair; and recording industry executives including Craig Kallman, CEO of Atlantic Records. <br />He also includes new information on Jay-Z's various business dealings, such as: <br />* The feature movie about Jay-Z and his first basketball team that was filmed by Fab 5 Freddy in 2003 but never released. <br />* The Jay-Z branded Jeep that was scrapped just before going into production. <br />* The real story behind his association with Armand de Brignac champagne. <br />* The financial ramifications of his marriage to Beyonce. <br /><br />Jay-Z's tale is compelling not just because of his celebrity, but because it embodies the rags-to-riches American dream and is a model for any entrepreneur looking to build a commercial empire."

But as a rapper, he’s sometimes not given the credit he deserves for just how great an artist he’s been for so long.<br /><br />This audiobook wrestles with the biggest themes of JAY-Z's career, including hustling, and it recognizes the way that he’s always weaved politics into his music, making important statements about race, criminal justice, black wealth, and social injustice. As he enters his 50s, and to mark his 30 years as a recording artist, this is the perfect time to take a look at JAY-Z’s career and his role in making this nation what it is today. In many ways, this is JAY-Z’s America as much as it’s Pelosi’s America, or Trump’s America, or Martin Luther King’s America. JAY-Z has given this country a language to think with and words to live by.&#xa0;"

Yet away from the spotlight, Alicia has grappled with private heartache—over the challenging and complex relationship with her father, the people-pleasing nature that characterized her early career, the loss of privacy surrounding her romantic relationships, and the oppressive expectations of female perfection.<br /><br />Since Alicia rose to fame, her public persona has belied a deep personal truth: she has spent years not fully recognizing or honoring her own worth. After withholding parts of herself for so long, she is at last exploring the questions that live at the heart of her story: Who am I, really? And once I discover that truth, how can I become brave enough to embrace it?<br /><br /><i>More</i> <i>Myself</i> is part autobiography, part narrative documentary. Alicia’s journey is revealed not only through her own candid recounting, but also through vivid recollections from those who have walked alongside her. The result is a 360-degree perspective on Alicia’s path, from her girlhood in Hell’s Kitchen and Harlem to the process of growth and self-discovery that we all must navigate.<br /><br />In <i>More Myself,</i> Alicia shares her quest for truth—about herself, her past, and her shift from sacrificing her spirit to celebrating her worth. With the raw honesty that epitomizes Alicia’s artistry, <i>More Myself </i>is at once a riveting account and a clarion call to listeners: to define themselves in a world that rarely encourages a true and unique identity.  <br /><br /><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Flatiron Books<br /></b><br />“[Alicia Keys] often sings snippets of her music, which brings her story to life and elevates the listening experience. Spoken cameos from everyone from her husband to Michelle Obama add another layer of interest to the audiobook. Keys fans will be delighted by the behind-the-scenes stories she shares; those unfamiliar with her music will still enjoy her upbeat, unpretentious narration.”  -- <i>Booklist</i>"

      "description": "<b>INSTANT NATIONAL BESTSELLER<br /><br /> Multi-platinum artist, entrepreneur, and philanthropist, Big Sean shares his five key practices for­ inner work and self-acceptance in this interactive guidebook on maintaining daily mental wellness.</b><br /><br />Sean Anderson, better known as Big Sean, has reached incredible levels of success in his music career. And while, from the outside, his life looks like a collection of enviable achievements, in truth, he has experienced the highest highs and the lowest lows that come with anxiety and depression.<br /><br /> At the age of eighteen, Sean decided to forgo college to sign with Kanye West’s record label. Even though he saw his wildest dreams coming true, he found himself contemplating taking his own life. It was in this, his darkest moments, that he started applying the spiritual practices he’d witnessed his mother embrace throughout his childhood from books like <i>The Four Agreements</i>, <i>The Secret</i>, and many more.<br /><br /> From that moment on, Sean has been on a journey of inward reflection, self-acceptance, and continual work to become the best version of himself every day. In these pages he walks you through the five practices—accepting, strategizing, trying, trusting, and manifesting—that have given him the skills and confidence to become the beloved father, musician, and man that he is today. <br /><br /> <i>Go Higher</i> dares to ask the question: If we worked on our self-care regularly, instead of only when we were in crisis, how much higher could we go? Filled with step-by-step instructions for the tools Sean has been using on a daily basis for the last decade—journaling, agreements, affirmations, and meditation, as well as prompts to guide you on your own journey of self-reflection, <i>Go Higher </i>is a “truly inspiring” (Dame Marie Diamond, author of <i>Feng Shui Your Life</i>) spiritual guidebook for our times, proving that investing in yourself isn’t something that drains your energy, but is something that gives you the energy to reach your fullest potential."

      "description": "<b>Clinical psychologist and author of <i>The Defining Decade, </i>Meg Jay takes us into the world of the supernormal: those who soar to unexpected heights after childhood adversity.</b><br /><br /> Whether it is the loss of a parent to death or divorce; bullying; alcoholism or drug abuse in the home; mental illness in a parent or a sibling; neglect; emotional, physical or sexual abuse; having a parent in jail; or growing up alongside domestic violence, nearly 75% of us experience adversity by the age of 20. But these experiences are often kept secret, as are our courageous battles to overcome them.<br /><br />  Drawing on nearly two decades of work with clients and students, Jay tells the tale of ordinary people made extraordinary by these all-too-common experiences, everyday superheroes who have made a life out of dodging bullets and leaping over obstacles, even as they hide in plain sight as doctors, artists, entrepreneurs, lawyers, parents, activists, teachers, students and readers. She gives a voice to the supernormals among us as they reveal not only \"How do they do it?\" but also \"How does it feel?\"<br /><br />  These powerful stories, and those of public figures from Andre Agassi to Jay Z, will show supernormals they are not alone but are, in fact, in good company.<br /><br />  Marvelously researched and compassionately written, this exceptional book narrates the continuing saga that is resilience as it challenges us to consider whether -- and how -- the good wins out in the end."

      "description": "The stories are as infamous as the artists who tell them. With their boasts of drugs, extortion and even murder, in today's world rappers need rap sheets before they can even hope to have a platinum record. So with all this grandstanding about their criminal nature, why haven't more hip-hop artists been busted for the crimes that they brag of, and why haven't high profile crimes replete with witnesses and media coverage ever been solved? Derrick Parker knows why. A veteran of the NYPD, Parker served as the lead detective in the -Rap Intelligence Unit, the first special force devoted to hip-hop crime. For over twenty years he served on the force, covering the hip-hop beat and uncovering the truth behind some of music's most notorious crimes. But in the midst of politics and internal strife, Parker's efforts to close the cases were stymied by the NYPD. <i>Notorious C.O.P. </i>will be the Serpico of the new millennium, exposing the flaws in the NYPD that have rendered them unable to adequately deal with the threat of hip-hop crime. From cops working part-time for the artists they are supposed to be pursuing, to their lack of understanding of gang culture and drug warfare, which has left not only these widely publicized murders unsolved, but has allowed notorious gang leaders to go unprosecuted for decades. Filled with photos, documents, interviews, and anecdotes, <i>Notorious C.O.P.</i> will be the most extensive and authoritative book ever written on hip-hop crime, exposing the facts behind the legends and the foibles of the NYPD that have left them unresolved to this day."

      "description": "For the first time, Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson opens up about his amazing comeback—from tragic personal loss to thriving businessman and cable’s highest-paid executive—in this unique self-help guide, his first since his blockbuster New York Times bestseller The 50th Law.<br /><br />In his early twenties Curtis Jackson, known as 50 Cent rose to the heights of fame and power in the cutthroat music business. A decade ago the multi-platinum selling rap artist decided to pivot. His ability to adapt to change was demonstrated when he became the executive producer and star of Power, a high-octane, gripping crime drama centered around a drug kingpin’s family. The series quickly became “appointment” television, leading to Jackson inking a four-year, $150 million contract with the Starz network—the most lucrative deal in premium cable history.<br /><br />Now, in his most personal book, Jackson shakes up the self-help category with his unique, cutting-edge lessons and hard-earned advice on embracing change. Where The 50th Law tells readers “fear nothing and you shall succeed,” Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter builds on this message, combining it with Jackson’s street smarts and hard-learned corporate savvy to help readers successfully achieve their own comeback—and to learn to flow with the changes that disrupt their own lives."

      "description": "The musician and Hip Hop legend—hailed as “the greatest MC of all time” and compared to Thelonious Monk—reimagines the writing handbook in this memoir and guide that incorporates the soulful genius, confidence, and creativity of a master artist.<br /><br />When he exploded on the music scene, musical genius Rakim was hailed for his brilliant artistic style, adding layers, complexity, depth, musicality, and soul to rap. More than anyone, Rakim has changed the way MCs rhyme. Calm on the mic, his words combine in a frenzy of sound, using complicated patterns based on multisyllabic rhymes and internal rhythms. Rakim can tell a story about a down-on-his-luck man looking for a job and turn it into an epic tale and an unforgettable rhyme. He is not just a great songwriter—he’s a great modern writer. <br /><br />Part memoir, part writing guide, Sweat the Technique offers insight into how Rakim thinks about words, music, writing, and rhyming as it teaches writers of all levels how to hone their craft. It is also a rare glimpse into Rakim’s private life, full of entertaining personal stories from his youth on Long Island growing up in a home and community filled with musicians to the clubs of New York and the studios of Los Angeles during his rise to the top of popular music. Rakim celebrates the influences that shaped his development, including the jazz music of John Coltrane and the spirituality of the streets, and shares anecdotes spotlighting personalities such as L. L. Cool J. and Dr. Dre, among others.<br /><br />Filled with valuable lessons for every writer, Sweat the Technique reveals the heart and mind of an artist and his love for great storytelling, and always, the words."

      "description": "Read by “Da Brat” DuPart and her wife Judy DuPart<br /><br />Hip-hop legend “Da Brat” DuPart and her wife Judy DuPart, stars of WEtv’s highly rated reality series Brat Loves Judy, share their journey to the altar and parenthood in this candid relationship guide and marriage memoir.<br /><br />Hip-hop legend Da Brat and beauty entrepreneur Jesseca “Judy” Harris-Dupart’s love story is as heartwarming as it is improbable. As rumors about her sexuality abounded, “Brat” believed she would remain “in the closet” until she took her last breath. But lightning struck when the rapper and the businesswoman met in 2017. Though their chemistry was instant and undeniable, the two went their separate ways.<br /><br />Reconnecting at the Essence Festival a few years later, Da Brat made the bold decision to publicly come out and confirmed their relationship in March 2020. Their love blossoming into their own successful reality show Brat Loves Judy, and two years later their marriage. Within a few months of sharing vows, the couple announced that Da Brat was pregnant, and on July 6, 2023, the pair welcomed a baby boy named True Legend Harris-Dupart.<br /><br />Part memoir and part relationship guide, The Way Love Goes, is laugh-out-loud funny and filled with warmth and love—just like its authors. Told in Da Brat’s signature Chicago tone, and Judy’s distinctive New Orleans patois, they each take turns detailing common relationship challenges, from sharing successful and meaningful communication to creating balance to coping with jealousy—and how they conquered them."

Hussle was determined to win the race to success on his own terms, and he wanted to see his whole community in the winner’s circle with him. <br /><br />A moving and powerful exploration of an extraordinary artist, <i>The Marathon Don’t Stop</i> places Hussle in historical context and unpacks his complex legacy. Combining on-the-ground reporting and candid interviews, “Rob Kenner has given us the book the world—and hip-hop and pop culture—has been waiting for…one that should be celebrated alongside the best biographies ever about iconic figures we have loved—and lost” (Kevin Powell, author of <i>When We Free the World</i>)."

Across a trailblazing career, he’s turned pain into poetry with anthems like “Day ’N’ Nite,” “Pursuit of Happiness,” and “Mr. Rager.” His music gave voice to the unheard and hope to the unseen.

While it may seem like he’s ahead of the game, he is actually plagued by anxieties, such as the fear of losing his roots, the fear of being a bad dad, and the fear of being a terrible husband. In the national bestseller <i>Shook One</i>, Charlamagne chronicles his journey to beat those fears and shows a path that you too can take to overcome the anxieties and emotional blocks that may be holding you back.<br /><br /> Ironically, Charlamagne’s fear of failure—of falling into the life of stagnation or crime that caught up so many of his friends and family in his hometown of Moncks Corner—has been the fuel for his grit and hustle. However, even after achieving national prominence as a radio personality and working with icons such as Russell Simmons, Gucci Mane, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, Charlamagne still found himself paralyzed by anxiety and distrust. Here, in <i>Shook One</i>, he is working through these problems—many of which he traces back to cultural PTSD—with help from mentors, friends, and therapy. Being anxious doesn’t serve the same purpose anymore. Through therapy, he’s figuring out how to get over the irrational fears that won’t take him anywhere positive.<br /><br /> Charlamange hopes <i>Shook One</i> can be a call to action: Getting help is your right. His second book “cements the radio personality’s stance in making sure he’s on the right side of history when it comes to society’s growing focus on mental health, while helping remove the negative stigma” (<i>Billboard</i>)."

Stoics focus on the things they <i>can</i> control, let go of everything else, and turn every new obstacle into an opportunity to get better, stronger, tougher. As Marcus Aurelius put it nearly 2000 years ago: “The impediment to action advances action.&#xa0;What stands in the way becomes the way.”&#xa0;<br /><br />Ryan Holiday shows us how some of the most successful people in history—from John D. Rockefeller to Amelia Earhart to Ulysses S. Grant to Steve Jobs—have applied stoicism to overcome difficult or even impossible situations. Their embrace of these principles ultimately mattered more than their natural intelligence, talents, or luck.<br /><br />If you’re feeling frustrated, demoralized, or stuck in a rut, this book can help you turn your problems into your biggest advantages. And along the way it will inspire you with dozens of true stories of the greats from every age and era."

His profound influence still resonates today, and he has been inducted into the Hip-Hop Hall of Fame, awarded the Soul Train Legend Award and given his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Now, Riley—with coauthor, award-winning biographer Jake Brown—lifts the curtain on his fascinating and inspiring journey with this unforgettable memoir of talent, resilience, collaboration, betrayal, and creativity.<br /><br />With heart and humor, Riley reflects on his beginnings as musical prodigy growing up in Harlem and the highs and lows of working with some of the biggest names in the industry. From masterminding his own acclaimed groups, such as Guy and Blackstreet, to producing groundbreaking hits such as Bobby Brown’s “My Prerogative” and writing and producing with legends like Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Mary J. Blige, Lady Gaga, and more, Riley takes us on a remarkable journey that parallels the explosion of new genres and Black influence in the contemporary music landscape.<br /><br /><i>Remember the Times</i> also candidly illustrates the evolution of popular music through the ’80s to today, taking us behind the scenes directly from the man who grew “to define the sound and reinvigorate contemporary R&amp;B and hip-hop” (<i>Mixdown Magazine</i>, Australia)."

For the first time, he gives an intimate look at his family background, his battles with drugs, his life of crime, his relentless suffering with sickle-cell anemia, and much more. Recently released after serving three and a half years in state prison due to what many consider an unlawful arrest by a rumored secret NYPD hip hop task force, Prodigy is ready to talk about his life as one of rap’s greatest legends.<br /><br /><i>My Infamous Life</i> is an unblinking account of Prodigy’s wild times with Mobb Deep who, alongside rappers like Nas, The Notorious B.I.G., Tupac Shakur, Jay-Z, and Wu-Tang Clan, changed the musical landscape with their vivid portrayals of early ’90s street life. It is a firsthand chronicle of legendary rap feuds like the East Coast–West Coast rivalry; Prodigy’s beefs with Jay-Z, Nas, Snoop Dogg, Ja Rule, and Capone-N-Noreaga; and run-ins with prodigal hit makers and managers like Puff Daddy, Russell Simmons, Chris Lighty, Irv Gotti, and Lyor Cohen.<br /><br />Taking the reader behind the smoke-and-mirrors glamour of the hip hop world, so often seen as the only way out for those with few options, Prodigy lays down the truth about the intoxicating power of money, the meaning of true friendship and loyalty, and the ultimately redemptive power of self. This is the heartbreaking journey of a child born in privilege, his youth spent among music royalty like Diana Ross and Dizzy Gillespie, educated in private schools, until a family tragedy changed everything. Raised in the mayhem of the Queensbridge projects, Prodigy rose to the dizzying heights of fame and eventually fell into the darkness of a prison cell.<br /><br />A truly candid memoir, part fearless confessional and part ode to the concrete jungles of New York City, from the front line of the last great moment in hip hop history."

      "description": "<b>Recorded at the legendary Electric Lady Studios in New York City, the audiobook features narration and storytelling by Questlove, who expertly weaves together a rich sonic tapestry of hip-hop tales large and small, well-known and obscure. From hearing “Rapper’s Delight” for the first time in 1979 to directing and producing the 50th Anniversary of Hip-Hop for the 2023 GRAMMYs, Questlove guides listeners through a musical journey brought to life by Questlove himself. <br /></b><br /><b>This program is read by the author.</b><br /><br /><b>\"From the nature of sampling, lyrics, and how music made the jump from vinyl grooves and mixtapes to streaming, Questlove’s curiosity, intelligence, and natural ability to compel listeners are on full display.\" </b><b>—<i>AudioFile</i></b> <b>(Earphones Award Winner)</b><br /><br /><b>\"Throughout, Questlove's resonant and impassioned voice serves as our noble guide. <i>\"</i></b><b>—<i>Booklist</i></b><br /><br /><b>\"The opening introduction, in which Questlove describes the stress of putting together a special hip-hop performance for the Grammys had me on the edge of my seat with tension and delight.\"—<i>The Guardian</i><br /></b><br />This is a book only Questlove could have written: a perceptive and personal reflection on the first half-century of hip-hop.<br /><br />When hip-hop first emerged in the 1970s, it wasn’t expected to become the cultural force it is today. But for a young Black kid growing up in a musical family in Philadelphia, it was everything. He stayed up late to hear the newest songs on the radio. He saved his money to buy vinyl as soon as it landed. He even started to try to make his own songs. That kid was Questlove, and decades later, he is a six-time Grammy Award–winning musician, an Academy Award–winning filmmaker, a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author, a producer, an entrepreneur, a cofounder of one of hip-hop’s defining acts (the Roots), and the genre’s unofficial in-house historian.<br /><br />In this landmark book, <i>Hip-Hop Is History</i>, Questlove skillfully traces the creative and cultural forces that made and shaped hip-hop, highlighting both the forgotten but influential gems and the undeniable chart-topping hits—and weaves it all together with the stories no one else knows. It is at once an intimate, sharply observed story of a cultural revolution and a sweeping, grand theory of the evolution of the great artistic movement of our time. And Questlove, of course, approaches it with not only the encyclopedic fluency and passion of an obsessive fan but also the expertise and originality of an innovative participant.<br /><br />Hip-hop is history, and also <i>his </i>history.<br /><br /><b>A Macmillan Audio production from AUWA Books.</b>"

In addition to marrying cultural icons with blue-chip marketers, Stoute has helped identify and activate a new generation of consumers. He traces how the \"tanning\" phenomenon&#xa0;raised a generation of black, Hispanic, white, and Asian consumers who have the same \"mental complexion\"—one based on shared experiences&#xa0;and values&#xa0;rather than the increasingly irrelevant demographic boxes that have been used to a fault by corporate America. But there is a language gap that must be bridged to engage the most powerful market force in the history of commerce.<br /><br /><i>The Tanning of America</i> provides the needed translation guide. Drawing from his company's case studies, as well as from extensive interviews with leading figures in multiple fields, Stoute presents an insider's view of how the transcendent power of popular culture is helping reinvigorate and revitalize the American dream."

      "description": "Humor is healthy. Author &amp; narrator Alfonso F.R. provides a vital tool for snapping millions out of hip-hop hypnosis, this audiobook. You’ve heard a disgusting hip-hop song today, haven’t you? The most pervasive poison in society is difficult to avoid. This \"music\" isn’t to empower, educate, or motivate you. It’s to hypnotize you into becoming a hedonistic derelict. Do you think it’s natural to listen to percussion instruments with a guy talking about drugs, violence, and depravity?<br /><br />The tribalistic war drums tap into your instincts to condition you into a life of idiocy. It isn’t music. It’s mind control for slaves. There’s a good chance you or somebody you know is tuned to this vibration of imbecilic immorality, vicarious delusionality, and squalor. It’s by design. The whole genre is as organic as astroturf. It doesn’t have to be this way. Snap out of hip-hop hypnosis now. The Sharter is a mirror for generations. It’s time to look within and ask ourselves if rap music is “good art” or a weapon against us? Is the music we’ve listened to for decades trash? How will we go forth after generations of hip-hop hypnosis? There is a solution.<br /><br />Author Alfonso F.R. launches his own psychological operations and this one is a tragicomedy-crime-classic; the most important allegory of our time. We can end the madness right now but you’re going to have to do yourself a favor: listen to this book, laugh your ass off, move forward with your life, spread the soil; lotus flowers start to bloom."

      "description": "<b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER • “Dapper Dan is a legend, an icon, a beacon of inspiration to many in the Black community. His story isn’t just about fashion. It’s about tenacity, curiosity, artistry, hustle, love, and a singular determination to live our dreams out loud.”—Ava DuVernay, director of <i>Selma</i>, <i>13th</i>, and <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i></b><br /><br /><b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY <i>VANITY FAIR</i> <b>• DAPPER DAN NAMED ONE OF <i>TIME</i>’S 100 MOST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE IN THE WORLD</b></b><br /><br />With his now-legendary store on 125th Street in Harlem, Dapper Dan pioneered high-end streetwear in the 1980s, remixing classic luxury-brand logos into his own innovative, glamorous designs. But before he reinvented haute couture, he was a hungry boy with holes in his shoes, a teen who daringly gambled drug dealers out of their money, and a young man in a prison cell who found nourishment in books. In this remarkable memoir, he tells his full story for the first time.<br /><br />Decade after decade, Dapper Dan discovered creative ways to flourish in a country designed to privilege certain Americans over others. He witnessed, profited from, and despised the rise of two drug epidemics. He invented stunningly bold credit card frauds that took him around the world. He paid neighborhood kids to jog with him in an effort to keep them out of the drug game. And when he turned his attention to fashion, he did so with the energy and curiosity with which he approaches all things: learning how to treat fur himself when no one would sell finished fur coats to a Black man; finding the best dressed hustler in the neighborhood and converting him into a customer; staying open twenty-four hours a day for nine years straight to meet demand; and, finally, emerging as a world-famous designer whose looks went on to define an era, dressing cultural icons including Eric B. and Rakim, Salt-N-Pepa, Big Daddy Kane, Mike Tyson, Alpo Martinez, LL Cool J, Jam Master Jay, Naomi Campbell, and Jay-Z.<br /><br />By turns playful, poignant, thrilling, and inspiring, <i>Dapper Dan: Made in Harlem</i> is a high-stakes coming-of-age story spanning more than seventy years and set against the backdrop of an America where, as in the life of its narrator, the only constant is change.<br /><br /><b>Praise for <i>Dapper Dan: Made in Harlem</i></b><br /><br />“Dapper Dan is a true one of a kind, self-made, self-liberated, and the sharpest man you will <i>ever</i> see. He is couture himself.”<b>—Marcus Samuelsson, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of<i> Yes, Chef</i></b><br /><br />“What James Baldwin is to American literature, Dapper Dan is to American fashion. He is the ultimate success saga, an iconic fashion hero to multiple generations, fusing street with high sartorial elegance. He is pure American style.”<b>—André Leon Talley, <i>Vogue</i> contributing editor and author</b>"

      "description": "Forged in the fires of the Bronx and Kingston, Jamaica, hip-hop became the Esperanto of youth rebellion and a generation-defining movement. In a post–civil rights era defined by deindustrialization and globalization, hip-hop crystallized a multiracial, polycultural generation's worldview, and transformed American politics and culture. But that epic story has never been told with this kind of breadth, insight, and style.<br /><br />Based on original interviews with DJs, b-boys, rappers, graffiti writers, activists, and gang members, with unforgettable portraits of many of hip-hop's forebears, founders, and mavericks, including DJ Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa, Chuck D, and Ice Cube, <i>Can't Stop Won't Stop</i> chronicles the events, the ideas, the music, and the art that marked the hip-hop generation's rise from the ashes of the '60s into the new millennium. Here is a powerful cultural and social history of the end of the American century, and a provocative look into the new world that the hip-hop generation created."

      "description": "<b>THE <i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER<br /><br />Angie Martinez is the “Voice of New York.” Now, for the first time, she candidly recounts the story of her rise to become an internationally celebrated hip hop radio icon.</b><br /> <b>&#xa0;</b><br /> In her current reign at Power 105.1 and for nearly two decades at New York’s Hot 97, Angie Martinez has had one of the highest rated radio shows in the country. After working her way up as an intern, she burst on the scene as a young female jock whose on-air “Battle of the Beats” segment broke records and became a platform for emerging artists like a young Jay Z. Angie quickly became known for intimate, high-profile interviews, mediating feuds between artists, and taking on the most controversial issues in hip hop. At age twenty-five, at the height of the East Coast/West Coast rap war, Angie was summoned by Tupac Shakur for what would be his last no-holds-barred interview—which has never aired in its entirety and which she’s never discussed in detail—until now.&#xa0; <br /> &#xa0;<br /> Angie shares stories from behind-the-scenes of her most controversial conversations, from onetime presidential hopeful Barack Obama to superstars like Mary J. Blige and Chris Brown, and describes her emotional, bittersweet final days at Hot 97 and the highly publicized move to Power 105.1. She also opens up about her personal life—from her roots in Washington Heights and her formative years being raised by a single mom in Brooklyn to exploring the lessons that shaped her into the woman she is today. <br /> &#xa0;<br /> From the Puerto Rican Day Parade to the White House—Angie is universally recognized as a powerful voice in the Latino and hip hop communities. <i>My Voice</i> gives an inside look at New York City’s one-of-a-kind urban radio culture, the changing faces of hip hop music, and Angie’s rise to become the Voice of New York."

      "description": "<b>The essential oral history of hip-hop, from its origins on the playgrounds of the Bronx to its reign as the most powerful force in pop culture—from the award-winning journalist behind <i>All the Pieces Matter,</i> the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling oral history of <i>The Wire</i></b><br />&#xa0;<br /><b>“<i>The Come Up</i> is Abrams at his sharpest, at his most observant, at his most insightful.”—Shea Serrano, #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Hip-Hop (And Other Things)</i></b><br />&#xa0;<br /><b>ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: <i>The Boston Globe, The Guardian, Spin</i></b><br /><br />The music that would come to be known as hip-hop was born at a party in the Bronx in the summer of 1973. Now, fifty years later, it’s the most popular music genre in America. Just as jazz did in the first half of the twentieth century, hip-hop and its groundbreaking DJs and artists—nearly all of them people of color from some of America’s most overlooked communities—pushed the boundaries of music to new frontiers, while transfixing the country’s youth and reshaping fashion, art, and even language.<br /><br />And yet, the stories of many hip-hop pioneers and their individual contributions in the pre-Internet days of mixtapes and word of mouth are rarely heard—and some are at risk of being lost forever. Now, in <i>The Come Up, </i>the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Jonathan Abrams offers the most comprehensive account so far of hip-hop’s rise, a multi-decade chronicle told in the voices of the people who made it happen.&#xa0;<br />&#xa0;<br />In more than three hundred interviews conducted over three years, Abrams has captured the stories of the DJs, executives, producers, and artists who both witnessed and themselves forged the history of hip-hop. Masterfully combining these voices into a seamless symphonic narrative, Abrams traces how the genre grew out of the resourcefulness of a neglected population in the South Bronx, and from there how it flowed into New York City’s other boroughs, and beyond—from electrifying live gatherings, then on to radio and vinyl, below to the Mason-Dixon Line, west to Los Angeles through gangster rap and G-funk, and then across generations.<br />&#xa0;<br />Abrams has on record Grandmaster Caz detailing hip-hop’s infancy, Edward “Duke Bootee” Fletcher describing the origins of “The Message,” DMC narrating his role in introducing hip-hop to the mainstream, Ice Cube recounting N.W.A’s breakthrough and breakup, Kool Moe Dee recalling his Grammys boycott, and countless more key players. Throughout, Abrams conveys with singular vividness the drive, the stakes, and the relentless creativity that ignited one of the greatest revolutions in modern music.<br />&#xa0;<br /><i>The Come Up</i> is an exhilarating behind-the-scenes account of how hip-hop came to rule the world—and an essential contribution to music history."

      "description": "Read by the author.<br /><br />INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER<br /><br />\"Sioux’s harrowing reality TV ordeal cuts deep, and her subsequent self-assurance is endearing and infectious. It adds up to an inspiring account of reclaiming artistic agency.” - Publisher’s Weekly<br /><br />When you’ve been told over and over that you belong at the bottom, how do you come out on top? Dance Moms star and triple threat Nia Sioux shows the way via her story of resilience, triumph, and defining success for herself.<br /><br />Young dancer Nia Sioux was only nine years old when she stepped into stardom as one of the original cast members of Lifetime’s reality TV show Dance Moms. Nia learned new choreography week after week and competed against dancers from across the country as well as at her own studio. Perhaps her greatest obstacle was suffering through her dance teacher’s ranking of the girls against each other in her infamous pyramid, where Nia spent the majority of her time on the bottom—all in front of an audience of millions.<br /><br />But there was much that viewers didn’t see. How her experiences in the studio went far beyond what made it into the show. How she was ostracized for not fitting into an aesthetic that wasn’t designed for girls like her. How her friendships and her mental health crumbled under the strain of the show. How she lost control of her story and her voice.<br /><br />But don’t be fooled—this is a story about resilience. Nia is not looking for pity, sympathy, or validation as she reflects on her experiences. Instead, she is choosing to use her story as a celebration of triumph. Nia finally gets to tell her story in her own way and in her own words. In this captivating memoir, Nia reclaims both the spotlight and her narrative.<br /><br />In addition to going behind the scenes of the seven seasons of Dance Moms, she shows how she fought against the negative perceptions that dominated her tween and teen years and emerged as a confident young woman secure in her talents and her direction. Anyone who has ever felt misunderstood, overlooked, or stuck at the bottom of the pyramid will be inspired by Nia’s story of overcoming. “Despite barriers and constant naysayers, assumptions and criticisms, only you know who you are inside and out,” Nia says. “And you have the power to create your own narrative, your own level of success.”"

      "description": "“A gripping journey.”—People<br /><br />The highly anticipated memoir from hip-hop icon Rick Ross chronicles his coming of age amid Miami’s crack epidemic, his star-studded controversies and his unstoppable rise to fame.<br /><br />Rick Ross is an indomitable presence in the music industry, but few people know his full story. Now, for the first time, Ross offers a vivid, dramatic and unexpectedly candid account of his early childhood, his tumultuous adolescence and his dramatic ascendancy in the world of hip-hop.<br /><br />Born William Leonard Roberts II, Ross grew up “across the bridge,” in a Miami at odds with the glitzy beaches, nightclubs and yachts of South Beach. In the aftermath of the 1980 race riots and the Mariel boatlift, Ross came of age at the height of the city’s crack epidemic, when home invasions and execution-style killings were commonplace. Still, in the midst of the chaos and danger that surrounded him, Ross flourished, first as a standout high school football player and then as a dope boy in Carol City’s notorious Matchbox housing projects. All the while he honed his musical talent, overcoming setback after setback until a song called “Hustlin’” changed his life forever.<br /><br />From the making of “Hustlin’” to his first major label deal with Def Jam, to the controversy surrounding his past as a correctional officer and the numerous health scares, arrests and feuds he had to transcend along the way, Hurricanes is a revealing portrait of one of the biggest stars in the rap game, and an intimate look at the birth of an artist."

Couch surfing all through high school and most of college, the quick-witted, sharp-tongued giant played football, ran drugs, and bounced at clubs to try to survive. After a false start with the WWE, he eventually became Snoop Dogg's bodyguard and traveled the world with the hip hop legend, biding his time and honing his rap. When the WWE urged him to return, George became \"Brodus Clay\" and, for the next several years, reinvented himself numerous times under the watchful mentorship of the legendary Dusty Rhodes, \"the American Dream.\" He was eventually christened \"Tyrus,\" and shortly after, a chance social media encounter with Greg Gutfeld at Fox News resulted in Tyrus finding a new skill: sage social commentator. Ferociously funny, blunt, and tenacious, <i>Just Tyrus</i> traces his unlikely and spectacular rise. As always with Tyrus, it's in-your-face and offers no apologies."

This is Taylor in his element: performing in front of live and writhing audiences demanding and receiving all the rough, raw, and authentic passion of Taylor Mali's poetry.\" <i>By Cristin O'Keefe Aptowicz, from the liner notes to <i>Conviction</i>.</i>"

      "description": "Joan Morgan offers a provocative and powerful look into the life of the modern black woman: a complex world in which feminists often have not-so-clandestine affairs with the most sexist of men, where women who treasure their independence frequently prefer men who pick up the tab, where the deluge of babymothers and babyfathers reminds black women who long for marriage that traditional nuclear families are a reality for less than forty percent of the population, and where black women are forced to make sense of a world where truth is no longer black and white but subtle, intriguing shades of gray.<br /><br />Still fresh, funny, and irreverent, <i>When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost</i> gives voice to the most intimate thoughts of the post–Civil Rights, post-feminist, post-soul generation."

      "description": "At once the most lucrative, popular, and culturally oppositional musical force in the United States, hip-hop demands the kind of interpretation Imani Perry provides here: criticism engaged with this vibrant musical form on its own terms. A scholar and a fan, Perry considers the art, politics, and culture of hip-hop through an analysis of song lyrics, the words of the prophets of the hood. Recognizing prevailing characterizations of hip-hop as a transnational musical form, Perry advances a powerful argument that hip-hop is first and foremost black American music. <br /><br />Perry offers detailed readings of the lyrics of many hip-hop artists, including Ice Cube, Public Enemy, De La Soul, krs-One, OutKast, Sean \"Puffy\" Combs, Tupac Shakur, Lil' Kim, Biggie Smalls, Nas, Method Man, and Lauryn Hill. Perry shows that while its message may be disconcerting, rap often expresses brilliant insights about existence in a society mired in difficult racial and gender politics. Hip-hop provides a unique public space where the sacred and the profane impulses within African American culture unite. The audiobook contains language that some may find offensive. <br /><br />The book is published by Duke University Press."

      "description": "A blueprint. A bible. What Sun Tzu’s&#xa0;Art of War&#xa0;was to ancient China,&#xa0;Pimp&#xa0;is to the streets. As real as you can get without jumping in, this is the story of Iceberg Slim’s life as he saw, felt, tasted, and smelled it. It is a trip through hell by the one man who lived to tell the tale—the dangers of jail, addiction, and death that are still all too familiar for today’s black community. By telling the story of one man’s struggles and triumphs in an underground world,&#xa0;Pimp&#xa0;shows us the game doesn’t change; it just has a different swagger.<br /><br />Only Slim could tell this story and make the reader feel it. If you thought&#xa0;Hustle &amp; Flow&#xa0;was the true pimp story, this book is where it all began. This is the heyday of the pimp, the hard-won pride and glory, small though it may be; the beginnings of pimp before it was dragged in front of the camera, before pimp juice and pimp style. Though it is a tale of his times, it will remain current and true for as long as there is a race bias, as long as there is a street life, as long as there is exploitation."

This journey to truth begins in the small town of Moncks Corner, South Carolina, and leads to New York and headline-grabbing interviews and insights from celebrities like Kanye West, Kevin Hart, Malcolm Gladwell, Lena Dunham, Jay Z, and Hillary Clinton.<br /><br /><i>Black Privilege </i>lays out all the great wisdom Charlamagne’s been given from many mentors, and tells the uncensored story of how he turned around his troubled early life by owning his (many) mistakes and refusing to give up on his dreams, even after his controversial opinions got him fired from several on-air jobs. These life-learned principles include:<br /><br />-There are no losses in life, only lessons<br /> -Give people the credit they deserve for being stupid—starting with yourself<br /> -It’s not the size of the pond but the hustle in the fish<br /> -When you live your truth, no one can use it against you<br /> -We all have privilege, we just need to access it<br /><br />By combining his own story with bold advice and his signature commitment to honesty no matter the cost, Charlamagne hopes <i>Black Privilege </i>will empower you to live your own truth."

From his famous “You ain't black” moment with President Biden, to heartfelt chats with cultural icons like Sean “Jay-Z” Carter and Judy Blume, to viral classics with Kamala Harris and Soulja Boy, his incredible reach and impact on American culture continues to grow.<br /><br />In <i>Get Honest or Die Lying: Why Small Talk Sucks</i>, Charlamagne takes full command of his new perch, broadening his scope and embracing his life roles as a cultural curator, social commentator, job-creator, mental health advocate, and Girl Dad in ways we’ve never seen before. In his signature irreverent style, he looks at the world through his own lens, concluding that many of our divisions, our unhappiness, and our dissatisfactions stem from our failure to have meaningful conversations with each other. With lessons pulled from his past, and an eye on the future, <i>Get Honest or Die Lying: Why Small Talk Sucks</i> makes us laugh, cry, and think as Charlamagneshares his thoughts on growth, empowerment, and evolution in our fast-changing world. In short—it’s time to stop lying to each other, and ourselves.<br /><br />Fame, money, social media, politics, hip-hop culture, and fatherhood, he takes it all on here. This master of seeing through the BS even calls it on himself, as he delivers his most insightful and heartfelt work yet—his call to stop the insanity while we still can."

You deserve to go on vacation. You deserve to care for loved ones without worrying about bills. You deserve to live the way you want, without reservations or fear. You deserve freedom—financial freedom. If you agree, you’ve come to the right place.<br /><br />We grew up in New York playing basketball together. As kids, both of us were fascinated by finance, curious about the stock market and how money moves among systems and pockets. But we began to notice that—for people in our community—hard work wasn’t enough. The system wasn’t set up to help people like us turn our hustle into lasting wealth.<br /><br />We started <i>Earn Your Leisure</i> to change that. We never could have imagined the response. Soon our little podcast started to feel more like a financial revolution. But a podcast can do only so much. This book is our answer to the thousands upon thousands of people who have asked us for a detailed blueprint. The key to earning your leisure is to see money as a strategic tool for wealth development. In <i>You Deserve to Be Rich,</i> you’ll learn how to:<br /><br /><b>• Deal with the psychological toll of growing up living paycheck to paycheck.<br />• Create income-building strategies outside your nine-to-five, from investing to side hustles.<br />• Use passive income to put you in control of your time and lifestyle.<br />• Master tax and insurance systems and identify (legal) loopholes to maximize wealth.<br />• Navigate family financial drama and find ways to support your community.<br /></b><br />That’s just the start. This book is full of tips, insights, and stories about real people, just like you, who have used the tools of wealth building to overcome barriers and build the life they want.<br /><br />You deserve to be rich. This is the playbook to make it happen."

      "description": "A new collection from David Sedaris is cause for jubilation. His recent move to Paris has inspired hilarious pieces, including Me Talk Pretty One Day, about his attempts to learn French. His family is another inspiration. You Cant Kill the Rooster is a portrait of his brother who talks incessant hip-hop slang to his bewildered father. And no one hones a finer fury in response to such modern annoyances as restaurant meals presented in ludicrous towers and cashiers with 6-inch fingernails. Compared by The New Yorker to Twain and Hawthorne, Sedaris has become one of our best-loved authors. Sedaris is an amazing reader whose appearances draw hundreds, and his performancesincluding a jaw-dropping impression of Billie Holiday singing I wish I were an Oscar Meyer weinerare unforgettable. Sedariss essays on living in Paris are some of the funniest hes ever written. At last, someone even meaner than the French! The sort of blithely sophisticated, loopy humour that might have resulted if Dorothy Parker and James Thurber had had a love child. Entertainment Weekly on Barrel Fever Sidesplitting Not one of the essays in this new collection failed to crack me up; frequently I was helpless. The New York Times Book Review on Naked"

He spent time in and out of juvenile detention centers, and school psychologists and counselors labeled him “criminal-minded.” His luck on the streets involving petty crimes would soon run out. After his involvement in an armed robbery, Wallo was arrested and received a prison sentence of nineteen to fifty-two years. Upon serving twenty years of his sentence, Wallo was released and returned home to Philadelphia.<br /><br /> This memoir traces the journey from Wallo’s youth and incarceration to his incredible success. In his time spent in prison, Wallo reckoned with the choices that put him there, accepted responsibility for his own actions, and vowed to arm himself with only good intentions upon his release.<br /><br /> Wallo’s reflection and newfound philosophy—which he now shares with you—informed the new trajectory of his life. Upon his release, Wallo moved back to Philly and committed himself to entrepreneurialism. His viral motivational content gained him over sixty-thousand Instagram followers on his first day of freedom. This would prove to only be the start of his continuously growing career utilizing his social influence as a motivational speaker, entrepreneur, and cultural changemaker.<br /><br /> “Full of energy, hard learned lessons, and no BS advice, <i>Armed with Good Intentions</i> is a must for anyone who wants to take a chance to bring their best to the world” (Erika Ayers Badan, CEO of Food52)."

The audio edition brings Butler’s groundbreaking and highly controversial arguments—jury nullification (voting \"not guilty\" in drug cases as a form of protest), just saying \"no\" when the police request your permission to search, and refusing to work inside the system as a snitch or a prosecutor—to a whole new audience."

      "description": "Half-Cuban, half-Puerto Rican, Luis \"DJ Disco Wiz\" Cedeño is 100 percent Boogie Down Bronx. Born in the 60s, Wiz struggled in a turbulent and violent relationship with his alcoholic father while trying to protect his mother, who was suffering from breast cancer. Raised in the 70s, Wiz learned the code of the streets while hustling with his crew, the East Side Boys.<br />In 1975, Wiz discovered salvation when he hooked up with the legendary Grandmaster Caz to form the Mighty Force Crew, waging some of the biggest DJ battles in the Bronx during hip hop's earliest years.<br /><br />When Hip Hop first hit, the DJ was king. Rockin' the party on two turntables for the b-boys and fly girls on the dance floor, DJs like Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa, and Grandmaster Flash pioneered an art form that has come to define our times.<br /><br />The first Latino DJ in the game, Wiz, along with Caz, went on to make a \"mixed plate\" in 1977 which combined sound bites, special effects, and paused beats. An innovator, originator, and a battle-style DJ with no fear, Wiz swept through the Bronx like a tornado.<br /><br />But the streets wouldn't leave him in peace. After being convicted on an attempted murder charge, sentenced to nine years in prison, and forced to leave his baby daughter, Wiz was incarcerated upstate at the tender age of 17, where he learned the true meaning of desperation. But as time went on and he overcame his struggles with violence, drugs and alcohol, and women, Wiz eventually liberated himself from the path of self-destruction through love, self-respect, and self-determination.<br /><br /><i>It's Just Begun: The Epic Journey of DJ Disco Wiz, Hip Hop's First Latino DJ </i> is a gritty and gripping tale of one man's struggles to not only survive but triumph over adversity and abuse. It will make your blood run cold. By conquering unimaginable obstacles, Wiz offers inspiration to anyone who has ever wondered, \"Why me?\""

      "description": "Vegas Concierge is the riveting inside story of a decade-long investigation into sex tracking, police corruption, and hip-hop music in Sin City. <br /><br />A layered saga spanning more than a decade, Vegas Concierge moves from the luxury hotel rooms on the Las Vegas Strip to the inner offices of the Las Vegas police and some of Nevada’s biggest news organizations. Using public and private records as well as exclusive first-person accounts from primary sources, this book shows how prostitutes and pimps ply their trade, how law enforcement agencies trip on themselves and their investigations become compromised, and how self-interest corrupts news organizations and the corridors of power. More than anything, this book examines the disregard American society has toward sex tracking victims.<br /><br />\"An investigative journalism tour de force on a painful problem that ultimately compels clearer-eyed action—and a page-turner of a book.\"—Duff Wilson, investigative reporter and three-time Pulitzer finalist"

      "description": "<b>A <i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER</b><br /><br /><b>A compelling and candid memoir from Allen Iverson, the NBA’s most misunderstood Hall of Famer, detailing his tough childhood in Virginia, his entry into the league as the number one overall pick, and his controversial, culture-changing pro basketball career.</b><b> </b><br /><br />In <i>Misunderstood</i>, Allen Iverson shares in searing clarity and touching candor his meteoric rise from impoverished child in the Virginia projects to high school champion to Georgetown University protégé of legendary coach John Thompson, and finally to NBA All-Star and Reebok’s Vice President of Basketball.<br /><br /> Allen Iverson is a household name—Boomers and Gen Xers watched his decades-long run as a scrappy, tenacious basketball player on the Philadelphia 76ers who redefined the sport’s style (both fashion-wise and playing-wise), while millennials and Gen Zers are perhaps more familiar with his Reebok line’s resurgence in popularity, his callout in Post Malone’s viral hit “White Iverson,” and for being the namesake of Kendall Roy’s son on <i>Succession</i>. Part athletic legend, part fashion icon, part hip-hop muse, Iverson was one of the first celebrities to fuse lifestyle, culture, and sports.<br /><br /> But while everyone may know his name, few have seen behind the curtain on Iverson’s tumultuous life. <i>Misunderstood</i> lifts the veil and brings you into the mind of the pugnacious, ultra-talented misfit whose foremost goal, more than fame or fortune, was always to lift his family and friends out of poverty and violence. In his memoir, Iverson explores how he completely shattered the mold dictating what an NBA star could be in the 1990s and 2000s, all while dealing with legal troubles and personal traumas that only contributed to his sense of individualism and star power. This is the unforgettable story of a trailblazer who not only changed the game of basketball but rewrote the rules of what it means to rise, fall, and rise again while staying unapologetically true to himself."

      "description": "<b>Award-winning actor, rapper, and producer Ice-T unveils a compelling memoir of his early life robbing jewelry stores until he found fame and fortune—while a handful of bad choices sent his former crime partner down an incredibly different path.</b><br /><br />Ice-T rose to fame in the late 1980s, earning acclaim for his music before going on to enthrall television audiences as Odafin “Fin” Tutuola in <i>Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</i>. But it could have gone much differently.<br /><br /> In this “poignant and powerful” (<i>Library Journal</i>, starred review) memoir, Ice-T and Spike, his former crime partner—collaborating with <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Douglas Century—relate the shocking stories of their shared pasts, and how just a handful of decisions led to their incredibly different lives. Both grew up in violent, gang-controlled Los Angeles neighborhoods and worked together to orchestrate a series of jewelry heists.<br /><br /> But while Ice-T was discovered rapping in a club and got his first record deal, Spike was caught for a jewelry robbery and did three years in prison. As his music career began to take off, Ice made the decision to abandon the criminal life; Spike continued to plan increasingly ingenious and risky jewel heists. And in 1992, after one of Spike’s robberies ended tragically, he was sentenced to thirty-five years to life. While he sat behind bars, he watched his former partner rise to fame in music, movies, and television.<br /><br /> “Propulsive” (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review), timely, and thoughtful, two men with two very different lives reveal how their paths might have very well been reversed if they made different choices. All it took was a<i> s</i><i>plit decision</i>.<br /><br /><b>Featuring an exclusive conversation with Ice-T, Spike, and Douglas Century!</b>"

      "description": "<b>Featuring an exclusive interview with Raekwon the Chef and his son!</b><br /><br /><b>Legendary wordsmith Raekwon the Chef opens up about his journey from the staircases of Park Hill in Staten Island to sold-out stadiums around the world with Wu-Tang Clan in this revealing memoir—perfect for fans of <i>The Autobiography of Gucci</i> <i>Mane</i> and <i>Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter</i>. </b><br /><br />There are rappers who everyone loves and there are rappers who every rapper loves, and Corey Woods, a.k.a. Raekwon the Chef, is one of the few who is both. His versatile flow, natural storytelling, and evocative imagery have inspired legions of fans and a new generation of rappers. Raekwon is one of the founding members of Wu-Tang Clan, and his voice and cadence are synonymous with the sound that has made the group iconic since 1991.<br /><br />Now, for the first time, Raekwon tells his whole story, from struggling through poverty in order to make ends meet to turning a hobby into a legacy. The Wu-Tang tale is dense, complex, and full of drama, and here nothing is off-limits: the group’s origins, secrets behind songs like “C.R.E.A.M.” and “Protect Ya Neck,” and what it took to be one of the first hip-hop groups to go from the underground to the mainstream. Raekwon also delves deep into the making of his meticulous solo albums—particularly the classic <i>Only Built 4 Cuban Linx</i>—and talks about how spirituality and fatherhood continue to inspire his unstoppable creative process.<br /><br />A celebration of perseverance and the power of music, <i>From Staircase to Stage</i> is a master storyteller’s lifelong journey to stay true to himself and his roots."

It details the early beginnings, starting in 1975, when disco was king, and by 1979, disco was dead and gave birth to the rise of hip hop.&#xa0;<br /><br />As a young DJ, club owner, and promoter by the age of 22, Lonzo had the hottest club in the city of Los Angeles, The Eve After Dark, where he met the young Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, and Cli N Tel, to form the legendary hip hop dance group, The World Class Wreckin Cru. With the hottest night-and-tight group, Lonzo created Kru Cut Records, where signed a teenage Ice Cube to his label.&#xa0;<br /><br />The audiobook will fill in all the gaps left by the movie <i>Straight Outta Compton</i>, including meeting Easy E and introducing him to Jerry Hellers. If you are a hip hop fan and want \"the real\" about the \"World's Most Dangerous Group\" and all the players that paved the way for West Coast hip hop, this is the audiobook for you, told by the man who was there from the very beginning."

      "description": "<b>How Ruffhouse Records founder Chris Schwartz overcame poverty, abuse, and addiction to start one of the most pivotal labels in hip-hop history and launch the careers of some of music's biggest stars</b><br /><br />\"All respect to Chris Schwartz. He is a great visionary.\" --Nas<br /><br />As a struggling musician trying to catch a break in 1980s Philadelphia, Chris Schwartz navigated the crime-infested, morally bankrupt music industry to found and build one of the most successful hip-hop record labels in the world. That label was Ruffhouse, which launched the careers of Nas, The Fugees, Cypress Hill, and others, dominating the charts and generating global revenues of over one billion dollars.<br /><br />Schwartz and his partner, Joe Nicolo, built Ruffhouse from one desk and a phone to one of hip-hop's most revered record companies while simultaneously struggling with drug addiction and alcoholism. A story of money, greed, envy, betrayal, violence, addiction, loss, and redemption, not to mention a whole lot of music, <i>Ruffhouse</i> reveals the inside story of the record companies, recording studios, tour buses, private jets, mansions, radio stations, and concert halls at the height of hip-hop's 1990s heyday, while also uncovering the darker side of the business, from police stations to rehab clinics, courtrooms to prisons. Narrated in Schwartz's own candid, searing prose, <i>Ruffhouse</i> is a gripping portrayal of hip-hop culture at its tipping point, as it transitioned from urban curiosity to a global commercial platform."

      "description": "<b>To understand hip hop, this is how the story goes, beginning in the year of ‘1980’.</b><br /><br />With the gradual shift from the 1970s disco scene, a new style of music known as hip hop paved&#xa0;way for underground music talent;&#xa0;creating local artists to pop up from all over the Brooklyn, The Bronx, Philly, and Jersey.&#xa0;Some refer to it as “The Golden Era” but rap music was just coming into its own in the early to mid-1980s. Artists such as Kurtis Blow, DJ Kool Herc, Afrikan Bambatta, Melle Mel, Whodini, Kool Moe Dee, Schoolly D, Run-DMC, LL Cool J and others brought a sound that remains urban America‘s loudest voice in modern-day known as hip-hop.&#xa0;<br /><br />This audiobook <i>The History of Hip Hop, Volume 2</i>, takes you behind the scenes and gives you the little-known details of the 1980s era which would lay the roots for an artistic experience that has built the existence of many rap artists now. Today‘s global hip-hop culture has inner-city American residents to thank for its recent-touted successes. Such historical references cited in this volume are:<br />\n\nKurtis Blow AKA&#xa0;the “Godfather of Rap” had the first gold single in history of hip hop music\n‘Rock Box’ by Afrika Bambatta was the first hip hop-rock guitar song which dropped on the 1982 album - “Planet Rock”\nKool Moe Dee and LL Cool J;&#xa0;&#xa0;hip hop’s first and toughest battle rappers faced off in the 80s, once and for all\nGrandmaster Melle Mel and the Furious Five’s \"The Message\" which highlighted the plight of living in inner cities\nThe Beastie Boys‘ rise to fame opened the door of hip hop to the homes of white America, thus resulting in mass commercial successes\nLL Cool J‘s album - \"Bigger&#xa0;and Deffer\" is lauded as the first successful rap-ballad.\n\"Self-Destruction\" (collaboration of East Coast rappers led by KRS-One whose DJ - Scott La-Rock - was murdered) debuted on the Billboard at Number #1 for ten weeks in a row\nand many more historical references&#xa0;…\n\n<br />The History of Hip-Hop, Volume 2 picks off where Volume 1&#xa0;left off. Get deeper into rap history&#xa0;with this volume which is a must-listen."

      "description": "J-Rod moves like a small tank on the court, his face mean, staring down his opponents. \"I play just like my father,\" he says. \"Before my father died, he was a problem on the court. I'm a problem.\" Playing basketball for him fuses past and present, conjuring his father's memory into a force that opponents can feel in each bone-snapping drive to the basket.<br /><br />On the street, every ballplayer has a story. Onaje X. O. Woodbine, a former streetball player who became an all-star Ivy Leaguer, brings the sights and sounds, hopes and dreams of street basketball to life. He shows that big games have a trickster figure and a master of black talk whose commentary interprets the game for audiences. The beats of hip-hop and reggae make up the soundtrack, and the ballplayers are half-men, half-heroes, defying the ghetto's limitations with their flights to the basket.<br /><br />Basketball is popular among young black American men but not because, as many claim, they are \"pushed by poverty\" or \"pulled\" by white institutions to play it. Black men choose to participate in basketball because of the transcendent experience of the game. Through interviews with and observations of urban basketball players, Onaje X. O. Woodbine composes a rare portrait of a passionate, committed, and resilient group of athletes who use the court to mine what urban life cannot corrupt. If people turn to religion to reimagine their place in the world, then black streetball players are indeed the hierophants of the asphalt."

      "description": "“I had experienced absolute freedom—I had felt that my body was without boundaries, limitless; that pain didn’t matter, that nothing mattered at all—and it intoxicated me.”<br /><br />In 2010, more than 750,000 people stood in line at Marina Abramović’s MoMA retrospective for the chance to sit across from her and communicate with her nonverbally in an unprecedented durational performance that lasted more than 700 hours. This celebration of nearly fifty years of groundbreaking performance art demonstrated once again that Marina Abramović is truly a force of nature.<br /><br />The child of Communist war-hero parents under Tito’s regime in postwar Yugoslavia, she was raised with a relentless work ethic. Even as she was beginning to build an international artistic career, Marina lived at home under her mother’s abusive control, strictly obeying a 10 p.m. curfew. But nothing could quell her insatiable curiosity, her desire to connect with people, or her distinctly Balkan sense of humor—all of which informs her art and her life. The beating heart of <i>Walk Through Walls</i> is an operatic love story—a twelve-year collaboration with fellow performance artist Ulay, much of which was spent penniless in a van traveling across Europe—a relationship that began to unravel and came to a dramatic end atop the Great Wall of China.<br /><br />Marina’s story, by turns moving, epic, and dryly funny, informs an incomparable artistic career that involves pushing her body past the limits of fear, pain, exhaustion, and danger in an uncompromising quest for emotional and spiritual transformation. A remarkable work of performance in its own right, <i>Walk Through Walls</i> is a vivid and powerful rendering of the unparalleled life of an extraordinary artist."

He’s dazzled by what they’ve accomplished, and they seem to think he has the potential to be as successful as they are. They invite him for a weekend away from it all—no wives, no cell phones, no talk of business. But far from home and cut off from everyone he loves, he discovers a disturbing secret that challenges some of his deepest convictions…<br /><br />Martin finds out that his glittering new friends are part of a secret society dedicated to the preservation of the institution of slavery—but this time around, the black men are called “Master.” Joining them seems to guarantee a future without limits; rebuking them almost certainly guarantees his death. Trapped inside a picture-perfect, make-believe world that is home to a frightening reality, Martin must find a way out that will allow him to stay alive without becoming the very thing he hates.<br /><br />A novel of rage and compassion, good and evil, trust and betrayal, <i>Forty Acres </i>is the thought-provoking story of one man’s desperate attempt to escape the clutches of a terrifying new moral order."

      "description": "<b>A <i>New York Times </i>Notable Book</b><br /><br /><b>A lively, immersive history by an award-winning urbanist of New York City’s transformation, and the lessons it offers for the city’s future.</b><br /><br />Dangerous, filthy, and falling apart, garbage piled on its streets and entire neighborhoods reduced to rubble; New York’s terrifying, if liberating, state of nature in 1978 also made it the capital of American culture. Over the next thirty-plus years, though, it became a different place—kinder and meaner, richer and poorer, more like America and less like what it had always been.<br /><br /><i>New York, New York, New York</i>, Thomas Dyja’s sweeping account of this metamorphosis, shows it wasn’t the work of a single policy, mastermind, or economic theory, nor was it a morality tale of gentrification or crime. Instead, three New Yorks evolved in turn. After brutal retrenchment came the dazzling Koch Renaissance and the Dinkins years that left the city’s liberal traditions battered but laid the foundation for the safe streets and dotcom excess of Giuliani’s Reformation in the ‘90s. Then the planes hit on 9/11. The shaky city handed itself over to Bloomberg who merged City Hall into his personal empire, launching its Reimagination. From Hip Hop crews to Wall Street bankers, D.V. to Jay-Z, Dyja weaves New Yorkers famous, infamous, and unknown—Yuppies, hipsters, tech nerds, and artists; community organizers and the immigrants who made this a truly global place—into a narrative of a city creating ways of life that would ultimately change cities everywhere.<br /><br />With great success, though, came grave mistakes. The urbanism that reclaimed public space became a means of control, the police who made streets safe became an occupying army, technology went from a means to the end. Now, as anxiety fills New Yorker’s hearts and empties its public spaces, it’s clear that what brought the city back—proximity, density, and human exchange—are what sent Covid-19 burning through its streets, and the price of order has come due. A fourth evolution is happening and we must understand that the greatest challenge ahead is the one New York failed in the first three: The cures must not be worse than the disease.<br /><br />Exhaustively researched, passionately told, <i>New York, New York, New York</i> is a colorful, inspiring guide to not just rebuilding but <i>reimagining</i> a great city."

Like her song, she was already “more than a woman” but her shocking death in a plane crash prevented her from fully growing into one.<br /><br />Now, two decades later, the full story of Aaliyah’s life and cultural impact is finally and lovingly revealed. <i>Baby Girl</i> features never-before-told stories, including studio anecdotes, personal tales, and eyewitness accounts on the events leading up to her untimely passing. Her enduring influence on today’s artists—such as Rihanna, Drake, Normani, and many more—is also celebrated, providing Aaliyah’s discography a cultural critique that is long overdue.<br /><br />“There’s no better way to pay your respect to R&amp;B’s true angel than to lose yourself in the pages” (Kim Osorio, journalist and author of <i>Straight from the Source</i>) of this “dazzling biography” (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>) that is as unforgettable as its subject. <br /><br />This book was written without the participation of Aaliyah’s family/estate."

Kelly and LL Cool J, sell millions of albums with her sensual dancing. In a word, Karrine was H-O-T. So hot that she made as much as $2500 a day in videos and was selected by well-known film director F. Gary Gray to co-star in his film, A Man Apart, starring Vin Diesel. But the film and music video sets, swanky Hollywood and New York restaurants and trysts with the celebrities featured in the pages of People and In Touch magazines only touches the surface of Karrine Steffans' life.<br /><br />Her journey is filled with physical abuse, rape, drug and alcohol abuse, homelessness and single motherhood—all by the age of 26. By sharing her story, Steffans hopes to shed light on an otherwise romanticised industry and help young women avoid the same pitfalls she encountered. If they're already in danger, she hopes to inspire them to find a way to dig themselves out of what she knows first-hand <br />to be a cycle of hopelessness and despair."

After enduring seventeen years of abuse and neglect, Bobby ran away from home and—with nothing more than a discarded laptop and a ninth-grade education—he found his voice in the world of hip-hop and a new home in a place he never expected: the untamed and uncharted wilderness of the social media age.<br /><br />In the message boards and livestreams of this brave new world, Bobby became Logic, transforming a childhood of violence, anger, and trauma into music that spread a resilient message of peace, love, and positivity. His songs would touch the lives of millions, taking him to dizzying heights of success, where the wounds of his childhood and the perils of Internet fame would nearly be his undoing.<br /><br />A landmark achievement in an already remarkable career, <i>This Bright Future</i> “is just like the author—fearless, funny, and full of heart” (Ernest Cline, #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Ready Player One</i>) and looks back on Bobby’s extraordinary life with lacerating humor and fearless honesty. Heart-wrenching yet ultimately uplifting, this book completes the incredible true story and transformation of a human being who, against all odds, refused to be broken."

Hemmed in by wildfires, it's a symphony conducted from an overpass, grandiose, comic, and as diverse as the city itself—from an author who has received the California Book Award and the Association for Asian American Studies Book Award, among other literary honors."

That random meeting might seem like the lucky break that changed Paul’s life. But a moment of good fortune means nothing without the struggle that gets you there. And the truth is, Paul had always been lucky.<br /><br /> Rich Paul became a gambler at an early age—his fast mind and gift for finding an edge made him a devastating dice roller who could hold his own with grown men, win big, and walk away alive. Shooting dice wasn’t just a pastime; it was a way to earn money for his family as his mother struggled under the weight of drug addiction. He learned the secret science of dice in the same place he found all the lessons of his young life: the corner store his father operated, the center of the neighborhood’s frantic action. Paul’s father had another family but kept his son close working at the store. Paul dreamed of becoming a star athlete, but the streets were where he thrived, building a lucrative enterprise on shaky ground. When he found himself at a dangerous crossroads, he summoned the teachings of his past to create a different future.<br /><br /> Readers will follow the riveting journey of a young Rich Paul narrated by the Paul of today, who looks back with wit and insight, drawing out the lessons he learned at every stage—about business, people, and the values that lead to success. It’s the inspiring story of the luck that’s all around us, if we know where to look."
